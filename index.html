      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on becoming a SOC Analyst. I’ve spent a lot of time in the trenches of TryHackMe and other CTF platforms, sharpening my skills in threat detection, log analysis, and incident response.

I’m comfortable working with a wide range of tools—whether it’s Wireshark for packet analysis, Splunk for digging through logs, or using SIEMs to make sense of alerts. I really enjoy investigating how things go wrong (and why), and figuring out how to stop it from happening again.

Right now, I’m building my portfolio with real-world inspired labs, ongoing learning, and projects that mimic the kind of work done in a Security Operations Center. I'm always up for a challenge and constantly exploring new ways to level up my skills.</p>

        <h3>Log Analysis & SIEM Investigation Project</h3>
        <p>Simulated a brute force attack and used Splunk to analyze authentication logs, identify malicious IPs, and map the attack timeline. Focused on log filtering, correlation, and alerting.</p>
        <h3>TryHackMe "SOC"/"Blue Team" Paths</h3>
        <p>Completed several blue team-focused rooms covering log analysis, alert triage, and threat detection. Developed hands-on experience investigating real-world attack scenarios in a SOC environment.</p>
        <h3>Threat Hunting Lab</h3>
        <p>Built a basic threat hunting lab using Security Onion. Simulated lateral movement and malware activity, then analyzed network traffic and host logs to uncover suspicious behavior.</p>
        <h3>Windows Attack Detection Lab</h3>
        <p>Executed common attacker techniques in a Windows environment (e.g., PowerShell abuse, privilege escalation). Used Sysmon and Event Viewer to detect activity and generate alerts.</p>
        <h3>Incident Response Simulation</h3>
        <p>Walked through a simulated incident involving a suspicious login and malware alert. Documented findings, developed a response plan, and outlined containment and remediation steps.</p>
        <h3>Phisphing Email Analysis</h3>
        <p>Analyzed a real phishing email sample. Inspected headers, links, and attachments to determine delivery method and potential payload. Report includes threat indicators and mitigation steps.</p>
